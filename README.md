- Hi, I’m @someitsi!
- I am a marketing consultant with some experience in data analysis and web development.
- I’m interested in expanding my web development skills. My endgame would be to be able to transition to a full stack web developer role.
- I’m currently learning some front-end techniques to supplement my knowledge and build a strong foundation.
- You can find me musing about my favourite hobby, chess, at my twitter profile (@someitsi)!
